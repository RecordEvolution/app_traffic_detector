# This is an example of an RTP source stream, which is what you'll need
# in the vast majority of cases: here, the Streaming plugin will bind to
# some ports, and expect media to be sent by an external source (e.g.,
# FFmpeg or Gstreamer). This sample listens on 5002 for audio (Opus) and
# 5004 for video (VP8), which is what the sample gstreamer script in the
# plugins/streams folder sends to. Whatever is sent to those ports will
# be the source of a WebRTC broadcast users can subscribe to.
